This project is based on Nodejs && Expressjs && mongoDB && Passportjs && angularJS
<br>
For the future planning, my personal view will add Socket.io into this.
<br>
I tried socket.io some days before and impressed by its idea, although I have notice a lot of websites using it like netease music and some IM websites.
<br>
This project is after all a trial for nodejs and a taste.
<br>
I didn't have a excellent overview or bird eye view for whole web architecture or some framework.
<br>
BUT I'M TRYING AND I GOT SOMETHING!
